# FIFA World Cup 2022 Analytics & 2026 Projections

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring team performance metrics, playing styles, and future potential from the FIFA World Cup 2022, with projections for the 2026 World Cup.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes team performance data from the 2022 FIFA World Cup to identify key success factors and team playing styles. The analysis covers multiple dimensions including squad age, offensive/defensive balance, set-piece effectiveness, and goalkeeper performance.

A key component of this project is the statistical modeling attempt to identify the most significant predictors of tournament success, which reveals the unique statistical challenges of analyzing small-sample, high-stakes tournament data.

## üîç Key Insights

### üéØ 2026 World Cup Potential
- **Most Promising Teams**: France, Spain, Ecuador, USA, Argentina
- **Young Squads with High Potential**: Ecuador (Age: 25.8), USA (Age: 25.4), Spain (Age: 26.4)
- **Youth Impact**: Young teams showed +70.3% improvement in goals per game

### ‚öΩ Performance Metrics
**Top Scoring Teams:**
- France (16 goals)
- Argentina (15 goals) 
- England (13 goals)
- Portugal (12 goals)

**Top Possession Teams:**
- Spain (75.8%)
- England (62.8%)
- Portugal (60.4%)
- Denmark (60.0%)

### üß≠ Playing Styles Analysis
Teams clustered into distinct playing styles:
- **Offensive Powerhouses**: Brazil, Germany, Spain
- **Balanced Approach**: England, Portugal, France
- **Defensive Specialists**: Morocco, Netherlands

### üé™ Set-Piece Effectiveness
**Top Aerial Teams:**
- Canada (58.9% aerial win percentage)
- France (57.6%)
- Costa Rica (55.9%)

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Strong correlation between corners and goals (r = 0.727)
- Strong correlation between aerial duels and goals (r = 0.667)

**Statistical Modelling (Python/Colab):**  
- A Binary Logistic Regression model was built to identify which performance metrics predict knockout stage advancement.

- A binary dependent variable, Reached_Knockouts (0 = Group Stage, 1 = Advanced), was created from the original Success_Score.

- Metrics used in regression: goals_per90, possession, tackles, aerial_won_pct, gk_clean_sheets, avg_age.

- Key Finding: The model produced a "quasi-separation" warning (Pseudo R¬≤ = 0.8265). This is a critical insight: the 16 teams that advanced were too statistically different from the 16 that were eliminated for the model to find a stable solution.

- Conclusion: This highlights the statistical challenges of modeling small-sample tournament data (n=32). Because of this separation, the model's individual coefficients and p-values are unstable and cannot be used to definitively name the most significant predictors.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Squad Age Analysis
- **Youngest Teams**: USA (25.4), Ecuador (25.8), Ghana (26.4), Spain (26.4)
- **Oldest Teams**: Belgium (30.6), Costa Rica (30.6), Iran (29.3), Croatia (29.2)
- **Tournament Average Age**: 28.1 years

## üìà Methodology

### Data Sources
- Comprehensive team statistics from FIFA World Cup 2022
- Performance metrics across 50+ variables including possession, passing, tackling, and scoring

### Analytical Approach
1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Distribution analysis of key performance indicators
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different metrics
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Grouping teams by playing styles
4. **Statistical Modeling**: An attempt to model success factors using a Binary Logistic Regression with the statsmodels library to understand what predicts advancement to the knockout stage.

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Offensive: Goals, shots, possession, passes completed, goals_per90
- Defensive: Tackles, interceptions, clearances, gk_clean_sheets
- Special: Set-pieces, aerial duels, goalkeeper performance
- Developmental: Squad age, player utilization, progression metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation
- CSV dataset with complete team performance statistics
- Statistical analysis using correlation matrices and distribution plots
- Implemented entirely in Google Colab, utilizing Python and its data analysis libraries
- Pandas library used for data loading, manipulation, and descriptive statistics.
- Statsmodels library used to build and evaluate the Binary Logistic Regression model.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn used for visualizations.

### Visualization
- Multiple chart types: bar charts, scatter plots, distribution graphs
- Comparative analysis across different performance dimensions
- Team clustering based on playing style characteristics

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQL database for querying team data
- Data visualization tools for PNG files
- Statistical analysis software (optional)
- All visualizations were generated and displayed directly within **Google Colab** notebooks

### Basic Analysis
```sql
-- Example: Query top scoring teams
SELECT team, goals, goals_per90, avg_age
FROM team_data 
ORDER BY goals DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
