- **Tournament Average Age**: 28.1 years

## üìà Methodology

### Data Sources
- Comprehensive team statistics from FIFA World Cup 2022
- Performance metrics across 50+ variables including possession, passing, tackling, and scoring

### Analytical Approach
1. **Descriptive Analytics**: Distribution analysis of key performance indicators
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different metrics
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Grouping teams by playing styles
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Projecting team potential for 2026 based on youth and current performance

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Offensive: Goals, shots, possession, passes completed
- Defensive: Tackles, interceptions, clearances
- Special: Set-pieces, aerial duels, goalkeeper performance
- Developmental: Squad age, player utilization, progression metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation
- CSV dataset with complete team performance statistics
- Statistical analysis using correlation matrices and distribution plots

### Visualization
- Multiple chart types: bar charts, scatter plots, distribution graphs
- Comparative analysis across different performance dimensions
- Team clustering based on playing style characteristics

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQL database for querying team data
- Data visualization tools for PNG files
- Statistical analysis software (optional)

### Basic Analysis
```sql
-- Example: Query top scoring teams
SELECT team, goals, goals_per90, avg_age
FROM team_data 
ORDER BY goals DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
